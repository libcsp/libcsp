libcsp 1.2, 25-10-2013
----------------------
- Feature release
- New: CMP service for peek and poke of memory
- New: CMP interface statistics struct is now packed
- New: Faster O(1) buffer system with reference counting and automatic alignment
- New: Thread safe KISS driver with support for multiple interfaces
- New: CSP interface struct now holds an opaque pointer to driver handle
- New: removed TXBUF from KISS driver entirely to minimize stack usage, added TX lock instead
- New: Pre-calculated CRC table .romem or PROGMEM on __avr__
- New: Added buffer overflow protection to KISS interface
- New: Allow posting null pointers on conn RX queues
- New: Lower memory usage on AVR8
- New: csp_route_save and csp_route_load functions
- New: option --disable-verbose to disable filenames and linenumber on debug
- Protocol: KISS uses csp_crc32 instead of it own embedded crc32
- Improvement: Use buffer clone function to copy promisc packets
- Bugfix: Fix pointer size (32/16bit) in cmp_peek/poke
- Bugfix: Issue with double free in KISS fixed
- Bugfix: Change rdp_send timeout from packet to connection timeout to make sending task block longer
- Bugfix: Fix conn pool leak when using security check and discarding new packets
- Bugfix: Add packet too short check for CRC32
- Bugfix: Accept CRC32 responses from nodes without CRC support
- Bugfix: Ensure csp_ping works for packets > 256 bytes
- Bugfix: Cleanup printf inside ISR functions
- Bugfix: Do not add forwarded packets to promisc queue twice
- Bugfix: Fix return value bug of csp_buffer_get when out of buffers
- Bugfix: Always post null pointer with lowest priority, not highest
- Bugfix: Add check on debug level before calling do_csp_debug, fixes #35
- Other: Export csp/arch include files
- Other: Remove the use of bool type from csp_debug
- Other: Moved csp debug functions to csp_debug.h instead of csp.h
- Other: Ensure assignment of id happens using the uint32_t .ext value of the union, quenches warning
