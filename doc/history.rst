History
=======

The idea was developed by a group of students from Aalborg University in 2008. In 2009 the main developer started working for GomSpace, and CSP became integrated into the GomSpace products.

The three letter acronym CSP was originally an abbreviation for CAN Space Protocol because the first MAC-layer driver was written for CAN-bus. Now the physical layer has extended to include SpaceWire, I2C and RS232, the name was therefore extended to the more general CubeSat Space Protocol without changing the abbreviation.
