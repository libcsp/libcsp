This directory contains files specific to the windows port of libcsp.

To compile and create a static library, execute:

  python waf configure --with-os=windows build

from the root of this project. Note python must be in PATH.

The build requirements are:
    * Windows Vista SP1
    * A recent version of MinGW _or_ MinGW-w64
    * Windows API headers
    * cPython 2.5 or newer

What provides the Windows API headers depends on the development environment:
Using MinGW: Headers provided by w32api package. windows_glue.h header is needed because these headers do not declare condition variables.
Using MinGW-w64: Headers should be available in the default configuration. You may have to compile the distribution from source. windows_glue.h should not be needed.
