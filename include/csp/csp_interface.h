 * Inputs a new packet into the system
 * This function is called from interface drivers ISR to route and accept packets.
 * But it can also be called from a task, provided that the pxTaskWoken parameter is NULL!
 *
 * EXTREMELY IMPORTANT:
 * pxTaskWoken arg must ALWAYS be NULL if called from task,
 * and ALWAYS be NON NULL if called from ISR!
 * If this condition is met, this call is completely thread-safe
 *
 * This function is fire and forget, it returns void, meaning
 * that a packet will always be either accepted or dropped
 * so the memory will always be freed.
 *
 * This functions replaces csp_new_packet().
 *
 * @param packet A pointer to the incoming packet
 * @param interface A pointer to the incoming interface TX function.
 * @param pxTaskWoken This must be a pointer a valid variable if called from ISR or NULL otherwise!
